# Hive Knowledge Capture

Run the mandatory memory gate, then preserve the existing explicit source-ingest path.

## Mandatory memory gate

1. When Wiki is enabled, review every user turn and completed task before the final response.
   Select only a durable, reusable `preference`, `workflow`, `decision`, `convention`,
   `project-profile`, or verified `outcome`. A normal question or quick-answer is not a fact candidate.
2. If the target contains `hive-source.json`, use `hive source-wiki` for the material
   source-task fact. Never use consumer knowledge paths in the source workspace.
3. For consumer knowledge, reject secret, credential, confidential, ephemeral, ambiguous,
   speculative, private-path, raw transcript, complete conversation, hook payload, tool output,
   cache, database, and runtime content with canonical write count zero.
4. For a safe explicit `user-root` user statement, normalize one atomic fact and use a stable
   `claim_key` plus `project-profile|decision|convention|preference|workflow`; do not create a
   request JSON or a provenance digest. Use the strict request schema only for reviewed artifacts,
   verified outcomes, replacements, or another supported scope. Do not retain the raw turn.
5. Run exactly one write-through request. Prefer the simple user-statement route:

   ```text
   hive knowledge remember --user-root <user-root> --user-statement <normalized-fact> --claim-key <stable-key> --kind <preference|workflow|decision|convention|project-profile> --output json
   ```

   For a reviewed artifact or another supported scope, use:

   ```text
   hive knowledge remember --user-root <user-root> --request <request.json> --output json
   ```

6. Require a schema-valid canonical Markdown and derived-index receipt before the final response.
   Identical input is a no-op. A contradiction, ambiguous scope, failed secret gate, or stale
   replacement digest stops the write and preserves current truth.

## Explicit source ingest

1. Confirm the source is explicitly selected or created by the current authorized task, bounded,
   non-confidential, and suitable for tracking.
2. Prepare an agent-reviewed Wiki Markdown draft that follows the installed knowledge schema and
   includes bounded outcome, criteria, and normalized provenance.
3. Run:

   ```text
   hive knowledge ingest --target <project-root> --user-root <user-root> --source <source-file> --wiki <reviewed-wiki-draft> --output json
   ```

4. Require a schema-valid success result and report its changed paths and evidence digest.
5. Run `hive knowledge lint --target <project-root> --user-root <user-root> --output json`.

## Safety

- Do not capture when Wiki is disabled.
- Never ingest a raw session, hidden prompt, secret, credential, or unbounded file.
- Keep Raw and Wiki Markdown canonical; treat SQLite as disposable derived state.
- Do not reproduce CLI mutation logic or write knowledge files directly when the command is unavailable.
