# Install-wide knowledge capture

- Global Wiki user guidance reviews every turn in every selected-host folder after installation.
- Project setup, a Hive harness, a marker, and an attached collection are not user-root capture
  prerequisites.
- Unregistered-target retrieval searches user-root and shared knowledge while excluding private
  and confidential knowledge.
- Capture is foreground, agent-reviewed, normalized, and bounded; no raw-prompt recorder.
- `0.9.1` Windows acceptance: an ordinary PortareFolium career statement created a user-root claim
  and receipt; a separate fresh Codex session recalled it automatically.

Observed quota exhaustion defers this capture gate and its lint. It never authorizes another tool call in the halted turn; a new request and fresh allowed usage are required.
