# Test Fault Isolation

Rust unit tests bind an injected activation failure to the owning test thread so
parallel update tests cannot consume it. Numeric process-scoped values remain supported
for isolated CLI subprocess conformance tests. Acceptance requires the parser regression
test and repeated parallel `hive-update` suites to pass. This rule was established while
qualifying the user-requested `0.8.0` test distribution.
