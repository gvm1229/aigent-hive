# Developer Binary Lifecycle

Source development uses a sandbox binary and an isolated user root. Global developer replacement and its legacy monitor deployment are refused before writes. Existing binary-only rollback cannot restore changed user projections. The Windows recovery tool authenticates the source CLI and stages only generated package files and ownership records in a reversible backup. Official CLIs recreate the projection and update the npm package. Actual 0.13.0 validation and interactive update passed; knowledge, settings and records were preserved. Public releases retain ownership checks. Same-version local dev projection authentication remains limited to matching live managed bytes.
