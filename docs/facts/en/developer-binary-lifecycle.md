# Developer Binary Lifecycle

`scripts/dev-install.sh --sandbox` builds a source-local `product-dev` binary. `--global`
backs up and atomically replaces the existing active Hive executable; `--rollback` restores that
executable only while the active developer digest still matches. These paths do not initialize,
delete, migrate, or otherwise change canonical user preferences, knowledge, index, directives,
Skills, or project `.hive` data. A local binary prints `local developer build`, never the public
`developer test build` identity. Only a local `-dev` binary may use an internally reproducible
prior user manifest plus matching live managed bytes as its projection-refresh base. Public stable
and test releases keep the signed historical-base requirement and fail closed when it is missing.
