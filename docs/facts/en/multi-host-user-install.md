# Multi-host User Install

`hive install` and user-scope `hive update` retain single `--host` compatibility and add
`--hosts codex,claude` plus repeated `--host codex --host claude`. Whitespace around commas is
accepted inside one argument; shell input containing that whitespace uses a quoted value such as
`--hosts "codex, claude"`. Host order follows the request.
Duplicate, empty, and unknown selections fail before mutation. Multi-host apply dry-runs every
host first, then executes sequentially. Aggregate JSON reports per-host results; a later failure
reports completed and failed hosts plus retained changed paths.
