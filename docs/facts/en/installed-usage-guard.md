# Installed Guard Target Boundary

Configured projects use max(global, project); source uses global policy and user-root runtime, never source consumer state. Non-Hive folders receive no per-target controls or state, while setup-free Skills remain available. Session controls require an exact configured target; unrelated damaged graph CURRENT is not authority. Source tasks run one start preflight, not a source-local watcher or repeated tool gate. The qualified opt-in Windows monitor keeps Codex open and permits direct resume without a lock. Saved opt-in alone does not establish live monitoring; global monitor disable is allowed outside projects.
