# Aigent Hive 0.10.0 Product Scope

The scope includes relation search, lossless upgrade, host-neutral continuation, automatic Korean
language handling, and optional vector search. Non-vector repairs merged into develop and passed
test.4 acceptance on three operating systems. Vector work continues on its dedicated branch.
The prior 50,000-chunk build failure remains valid history. Final quality, speed, and isolation
gates remain required. The next vector-inclusive public test is test.5. Stable integration,
publication, and installation require explicit version-specific approval.
