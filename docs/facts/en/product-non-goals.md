# Product Non-goals

Hive is not a model runtime, provider session engine, provider API client,
credential store, or direct model/subagent process launcher. Hive-native logical
scheduling and iterative, team, and multi-goal control are permitted behind
implementation, host-qualification, consent, and activation gates.
