# Authenticated Projection Upgrade Purge

Global setup removes a retired `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` only when the retired-name ledger
and a shipped historical Hive digest both match its active bytes. The project refresh path already
uses the authenticated project base inventory: an unmodified retired path absent from the incoming
projection is deleted, while modified or foreign bytes remain protected.

For Hive directives and the Hive-owned marker in `AGENTS.md`, an incoming rule with safety or
ownership content replaces an overlapping prior Hive rule. Disjoint user additions, foreign blocks,
and overlapping non-safety local rules retain local priority. Every refresh keeps preview, digest,
atomic apply, rollback, and empty owned-directory cleanup boundaries.
