# Automatic Numbered-Test Release Gate

No separate approval prompt for a numbered test. At milestone completion,
the agent writes the next package number, checked plan IDs, and product digest to
`docs/test-release-intent.json`. `check-test-release-gate.py` compares that intent and the accepted
product tree with the candidate. New product bytes proceed through candidate,
publication, and public acceptance automatically. Identical product trees, docs, plans, facts,
source-only Skills/directives, tests, CI, and notices are refused. Stable approval stays explicit.

Required CI must pass for the exact candidate SHA. Record changed retry inputs; investigate
all failed jobs and OS-gated forms after a second same-family failure. No unchanged retry.
