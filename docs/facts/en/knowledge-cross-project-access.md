# Explicit Cross-Project Knowledge Access

Automatic retrieval in Project A uses only A, `user-root`, and verified shared knowledge. It
does not include Project B private knowledge.

When the user explicitly names Project B or a unique collection alias, Hive resolves that
reference fail-closed and queries B directly. The result excludes A, `user-root`, and unrelated
shared collections. Confidential content retains its exact-query authorization requirement.

Reviewed safe-general decisions, conventions, and workflows with explicit applicability are
promoted automatically during scan apply and rescan maintenance. The transaction records source
provenance and promotion status; stale source evidence invalidates its derived shared claim.
Retrieval never causes promotion.
