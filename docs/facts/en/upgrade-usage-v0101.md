# Harness Upgrade and Usage Policy Repair in 0.10.1

- Project upgrade: authenticate historical full base, migrate state, then render current output.
- Skill selection: allow declared lifecycle merges; reject duplicates, unknown ids, and tamper.
- `0.9.5`: `iterative-execution|ralph-loop` becomes one `verified-workflow`.
- Registry: exact project/user digests and generated published-prerelease overlay chains, including frozen `v0.10.0` release bytes.
- Usage halt: bind the effective policy digest and recheck a changed threshold in the same session.
- Recheck: remove the exact old halt on allow; replace it on limited or unknown; no guard disable.
- The old same-process recovery limit was superseded by 0.10.3 remeasurement; 0.11.0 reset acknowledgement is separate.
