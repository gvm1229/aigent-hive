# Overhaul subscriber notice approval

On 2026-11-12, the maintainer approved all subscriber notices until the whole overhaul plan is complete. Notice and committed SHA-256 file reach main through the reviewed develop-to-main PR. Set `AIGENT_HIVE_SUBSCRIBER_APPROVAL=main-pr` once in `release-publication`; no per-release secret. Stable publication with `send_subscriber_update=true` needs no further notice approval. Release verification remains required.
