# Host-Neutral Continuation Gate

Hive keeps run and closure decisions in provider-neutral Markdown. Read-only `hive run closure`
reports matching plan and status criteria with a closure digest. A `blocked` or `usage-limited`
checkpoint must list every still-unpassed criterion as `blocked_criteria`; a partial list is
rejected without a write. The host owns task execution. Hooks may provide one bounded nudge and
must not mutate host goals, tasks, or canonical run state.
