# Response Language Consistency

Source-development agents and installed consumer harnesses use the selected
language for every question and response. Only an explicit request for the
current response permits another language; message language alone does not
change the preference. User-scope and project guidance bind the exact `en|ko`
value. Acceptance: an always-loaded source rule plus passing unit,
static-contract, and connected lifecycle tests. Origin: maintainer request to
enforce the installation-selected language across source and product sessions.
