# Interactive Binary Update

Bare `hive update` requires an interactive terminal and uses the selected interface language.
It resolves npm `latest`, authenticates the running npm package manifest or direct receipt,
previews the exact owner adapter, installs only after explicit acceptance, and revalidates the
activated owner and version. A `0.9.0-test.N` owner remains valid for a later exact stable
`0.9.0` update without losing ownership evidence. Decline, EOF, and noninteractive calls make no
installation change.
