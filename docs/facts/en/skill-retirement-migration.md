# Skill Retirement Migration

The historical registry permanently covers every npm or GitHub stable release (`0.8.0` and
`0.9.0` through `0.9.5`) and must append each future stable snapshot before publication. The `0.10.0` updater
authenticates historical Skill bytes directly; it does not install every
intermediate release. The registry covers every released 0.8.0 and 0.9.x stable snapshot.
The lifecycle ledger requires version and direct replacement for each 0.10.0 rename or merge.
Exact Hive-owned retired files, host projections, manifest entries, and empty
directories are removed atomically with canonical activation. A safe local merge is permitted.
Unknown or foreign bytes are preserved and block successful activation, so no successful upgrade
leaves a retired discoverable Skill.
