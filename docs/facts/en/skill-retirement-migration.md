# Skill Retirement Migration

The historical registry permanently covers every npm or GitHub stable release (`0.8.0` and
`0.9.0` through `0.9.5`) and must append each future stable snapshot before publication. The
`0.10.0` updater authenticates historical Skill bytes directly; it does not install every
intermediate release.
The lifecycle ledger requires version and direct replacement for each 0.10.0 rename or merge.
Exact Hive-owned retired files, host projections, manifest entries, and empty
directories are removed atomically with canonical activation. A safe local merge is permitted.
Unknown or foreign bytes are preserved and block successful activation, so no successful upgrade
leaves a retired discoverable Skill.
