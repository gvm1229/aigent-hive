# Skill Retirement Migration

The historical registry permanently covers every npm or GitHub stable release (`0.8.0` and
`0.9.0` through `0.9.5`) and must append each future stable snapshot before publication. The `0.10.0` updater
authenticates historical Skill bytes directly; it does not install every
intermediate release. Exact Hive-owned retired files, host projections, manifest entries, and empty
directories are removed atomically with canonical activation. A safe local merge is permitted.
Unknown or foreign bytes are preserved and block successful activation, so no successful upgrade
leaves a retired discoverable Skill.
