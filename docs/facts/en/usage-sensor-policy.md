# Usage Sensor Policy

Each host uses a qualified native machine surface first. CodexBar is an optional,
explicitly consented fallback for allowlisted unavailable or unsupported native
results, never a bypass for a native limited decision.

Expedited setup enables the guard at `20%` remaining. Normal setup names or asks
about CodexBar only after a native-only probe returns an allowlisted failure.
