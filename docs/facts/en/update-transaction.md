# Update Transaction

After verification and a deterministic dry run, Hive snapshots protected canonical
bytes, writes a durable journal before mutation, activates only renderer-owned paths,
and rolls back only when exact before or after digests authorize recovery.
Historical full-base sources authenticate every projected file before activation.
