# Verification Result Clarity

Hive source agents and installed consumer harnesses qualify every passed,
failed, skipped, deferred, unverified, and unsupported result with the affected
scope, exact reason, current host or platform relationship, execution status,
and what the result proves or leaves unverified. Platform labels alone never
stand in for whether a check actually ran. Acceptance: source, consumer, and
project guidance agree and their projection tests pass. Origin: maintainer
request after an ambiguous Windows skip summary could be read as either prior
Windows verification or mistaken non-Windows detection.
