# Agent Directive Ownership

The source `AGENTS.md` and consumer `AGENTS.md` projection are small routers. Detailed rule
families have one canonical directive owner, while generated entrypoints keep only approved
summaries. A static gate verifies byte budgets, route targets, current projection parity, and
non-allowlisted normalized rule duplicates. Historical project and user bases remain immutable.
Stable publication still requires explicit approval for the named version.
Without a newly named version, source development stays on the product version and next numbered
public test in the active plan; the agent must not invent a later destination.
