# Hive Preserving Uninstall

- Remove Hive activation, projections, package state, indexes, backups, transactions, and runtime.
- Preserve knowledge, saved preferences, and foreign bytes.
- The `test.19` Mac audit found 44 retired empty `agents/` leaves and an empty transaction directory.
- Install, update, and uninstall now prune authenticated Hive-owned empty ancestors leaf-to-root.
- The exact 44-leaf fixture and the `0.9.1` Windows preserving reinstall both converged to zero
  retired empty `agents/` leaves and zero empty transaction directories.
- Keep `.hive/dev-install` as separate developer rollback state.

In 0.12.1, an enabled usage monitor blocks uninstall until its owned scheduled task is disabled.
