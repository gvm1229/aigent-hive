# Hive Preserving Uninstall

`hive uninstall` removes the exact Hive host activation, Hive projections, Hive package state,
derived index, backups, transactions, and runtime state. It preserves `.hive/knowledge/`, saved
user preferences, foreign host entries, and non-Hive user files. The command has no `--full` or
`-f` mode. Removing knowledge or preferences is a manual, user-owned action.

A later `hive install --scope user --apply` detects the preserved preferences and completes the
user-scope setup without asking the setup questions again.
