# Shared Index Target Path Safety

Shared knowledge queries and mutations inspect the supplied consumer target and
reject any existing symbolic-link component before canonicalizing the path. The
retired project-local `.hive/index/.stale` marker is inert: shared queries and
rebuilds neither follow nor mutate it. Acceptance: linked registered-project
aliases fail without project changes, while a linked legacy marker remains
unchanged during successful shared-index operations. Origin: cross-platform CI
exposed Windows link tests that a non-elevated local Windows host could not run.
